# Wordle-Solver
Solve the NYT version of Wordle in two ways! Either choose your own answer (from the solutions list) and watch the program play the game or use the program as your helper as you play the game live online!

Solve Game Instructions:
  Open the answer.txt file, type in your desired answer word, save the file, then run the program.
  Be careful to choose a word from the official list of wordle solutions, found in solutions.txt
  
 Live Play Game Instructions:
  Run the program, play the word the program guesses on your wordle game, enter the results in the format below, then repeat until the word is solved
  Results format:
    Nothing: 0
    Yellow: 1
    Green: 2
  Make sure to separate the results with a ", "
  
  The starting word "roate" is hard coded into the program, because my method of finding the best word takes quite some time and this process only needs to be done once.
